## About authenticator
It applies the idea of signup, login and account deletion using express and bcrypt in the backend (you can check the backend code <a href="https://github.com/nitin-is-me/authenticator-backend">here).</a><br><br>
You can view the live demo <a href="https://nitin-is-me.github.io/authenticator/">here.</a>

PS : It's just an account authenticator. Stretching it to a fully fledged social media would be a real pain.
